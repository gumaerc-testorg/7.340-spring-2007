description: This resource contains lecture notes on pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs), toll-like receptors (TLRs), the identification of microbially-derived
  ligands that stimulate mammalian TLRs and the downstream signal transduction events
  they elicited, evidence that TLRs are also involved in detecting viruses and initiate
  antiviral responses, how such an antiviral immune response is elicited, and how
  Vaccinia virus has evolved effectors to inhibit these intracellular signaling cascades
  to promote virulence.
